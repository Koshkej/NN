An experimental repository dedicated to exploring computational intelligence in its most fundamental form. It serves as a conceptual playground for ideas around learning systems, adaptive algorithms, and the mechanics of artificial reasoning, emphasizing clarity of structure over rigid frameworks. The project is intentionally minimal and open-ended, encouraging modification, reinterpretation, and use as a foundation for a wide range of research, educational, or creative experiments in machine intelligence.
